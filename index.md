## Biography

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dawei Zhu, a 2nd year Ph.D. student at Peking University. I'm supervised by Prof. [Sujian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RvBDhSwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from School of EECS, Peking University.

My research focuses on Long Context Modeling. I believe that the ability to effectively process extremely long contexts is a crucial aspect for future language models and multi-modal models, ultimately leading us closer to AGI. Besides, I'm also interested in a broad range of topics, including Agent, Alignment, and the advancement of Multi-modal models.

## News

- **[Apr. 2024]** Our new paper [LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12096) is out.

- **[Jan. 2024]** Our PoSE paper get accepted to ICLR 2024! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

- **[Sept. 2023]** We introduce [Positional Skip-wisE training (PoSE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10400) to decouple traing length and target context length, facilitating efficient context window extension of LLMs.
