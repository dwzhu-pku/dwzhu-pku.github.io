## Biography

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dawei Zhu, a 2nd year Ph.D. student at Peking University. I'm supervised by Prof. [Sujian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RvBDhSwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from School of EECS, Peking University.

My research focuses on advancing LLMs to process extremely long contexts. 

## News

- **[Apr. 2024]** Our new paper "LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval" is out. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12096) [[repo]](https://github.com/dwzhu-pku/LongEmbed)
